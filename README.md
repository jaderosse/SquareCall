# Reasons for Development Decisions

When Steve and I sat down to talk about what he needed and wanted from the site, there were three big things that stood out for me; Steve needed to be able to edit the content without having a lot of technical know how, It needed a new color scheme(something more lively), and it needed a new clean organization(compare to the last site).

1) So my first decision was to work with Django because of how Django sets up the admin site automatically and allows the admin to work with the database in a very simple way. This also made it so he could update the site from anywhere with an internet connection.

2) The color scheme on the old website was dark, I started thinking about other color schemes when Steve sent me a logo made for him by East Side Plus(a Square Dancing club he plays a large roll in). So I decided to run with that, it added color and lots of options for things to highlight it in the color scheme.

3) The old site had several pages with sections and sub-pages, many of these were filled with redundant information. So what I did was boiled it down to four pages, combining much of the information. this cleaned up the navbar and gave the site a more manageable feel to the user.


# Update

As of the time I am writing this, the site is still being worked on and I hope to finish in the next few weeks

Some of the things to be added:
    A calendar
    form to sign up for the news letter
    added functionality for the admin
    validations for the database
    possibly a youtube channel for Steve to post video and stream them to the site
